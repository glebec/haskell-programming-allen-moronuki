# Iniparse

Note: in the process of developing this exercise I discovered that the INI parser I wrote for the testing chapter cannot parse the full INI grammar. The exercise demonstrates the use of IO to read a directory of files; in the interest of moving on I am leaving the broken INI parse in for now.
