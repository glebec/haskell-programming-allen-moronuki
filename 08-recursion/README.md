# 8. Recursion

One way to look at recursion is as an indeterminate number of compositions of an endomorphism.

`type` for aliases.

```hs
type Numerator = Integer
type Denominator = Integer
type Quotient = Integer
```

Different from `newtype`, which constructs an actual new type that is distinct from its base type.

Using a `go` function similar to what I've called "inner recursion" sometimes, inner recursive function takes different params than wrapping parent function. In JS we could use a variadic function.
