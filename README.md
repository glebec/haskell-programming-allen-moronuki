# Haskell Programming from First Principles

## Solution & Exercise Repo

This repo is my personal scratchpad for studying Haskell through Chris Allen and Julie Moronuki's excellent introductory [book](http://haskellbook.com/). It is not an official solutions repo; any and all mistakes are my own. Some of the files may contain omissions, variations, extensions, or experiments on top of what the book presents; note files are intended not to summarize or outline chapters, but rather for me to jot down novel or related information.
